Using of fastlane - the tool for automatic app distributions

This project is using fastlane, which is written in ruby to automate the distribution, build and enroll process completly automaticly.
I build a customised fastlane script for Android and iOS which runs completly automatically with usually just one command line. 

Embedded in this solution:
Play Store, App Store, GitLab, Slack, Fabric.io, Gradle
